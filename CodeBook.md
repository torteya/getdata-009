===========
The data contained in tidy.txt corresponds to the averages of the mean and standard
deviation for the data contained in the raw data set. The averages where done by activity
and by subject (participant).

List of Variables in tidy.txt data set:
* AveragedBy: Subject (1-30) or activity (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking
downstairs and walking upstairs) that was used to obtain the average from the raw data set
* TimeBodyAccMean(X,Y,Z): Time domain signal average for body acceleration components
(from accelerometer) in all 3 axes.
* TimeBodyAccStd(X,Y,Z): Time domain signal standard deviation for body acceleration 
components(from accelerometer) in all 3 axes.
* TimeGravityAccMean(X,Y,Z): Time domain signal average for gravity acceleration components
(from accelerometer) in all 3 axes.
